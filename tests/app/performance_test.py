    '''Test for Voila serving several clients concurrently.
    Several clients connect to the Voila server URL at the same time, and each one gets a dedicated kernel.
    The served notebook consists of a number of cells that just wait for some time and log their execution
    time (from the end of the previous cell). At the end of the notebook, the results are written to a unique
    file.
    This allows for testing the performance of serving all the cells concurrently when all the clients are
    requesting them at the same time. Ideally, the time needed to serve a cell should be close to the cell
    sleeping time. When all clients receive the entire notebook, we kill them as well as the Voila server
    (there is a timeout to check that the clients don't wait too long). Then we compute the cell execution
    mean time. It is an error if it is much greater than the ideal value (sleep_per_cell), and we allow for
    some lag time (given by exceed_pct).

    Keyword arguments:
    sleep_per_cell -- number of seconds a cell waits for (default 0.1)
    cell_nb -- number of waiting cells in the notebook (default 100)
    kernel_nb -- number of kernels to launch in parallel (default 10)
    exceed_pct -- time budget exceedance, in percentage of sleep_per_cell (default 200)
    ipynb_path -- path to the saved notebook (default 'tests/notebooks/sleep.ipynb')
